# Qatalyst: Quantum Algorithm API Hub 🚀

Welcome to **Qatalyst**! 
If you're curious about quantum computing but not sure where to start, you're in the right place.
Qatalyst is my little playground where I'm learning by building, bringing together some of the most interesting quantum algorithms and making them available as simple FastAPI endpoints.
The idea is to help people (like you and me) explore how these algorithms work, what they can do, and how they might actually solve problems beyond just theory.
Whether you're just dipping your toes into the quantum world or already neck-deep in qubits, I hope this project helps you learn something new and maybe even inspires you to build your own thing.

## ✨ Why Qatalyst?

* **Learn by Doing**: Dive into practical implementations of classic quantum algorithms.
* **Modular & Extensible**: Pick and choose which algorithms you want to play with via simple API calls.
* **Hands-On Applications**: See the power of quantum computing in action, from search problems to optimization.

## 🔌 Tech Stack

* **FastAPI**: Lightning-fast Python web framework for building APIs.
* **Qiskit**: IBM’s open-source SDK for working with quantum circuits and simulators.
* **Future Frontend **: HTML, CSS, JavaScript—coming soon if you’d like a more interactive UI!

## 🚀 Getting Started

1. **Clone the repo**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/ZakisCodes/Qatalyst.git
   cd Qatalyst
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Run the server**

   ```bash
   fastapi dev src
   ```

4. **Explore the endpoints**

   * `POST /grover` → run Grover’s search
   * `POST /deutsch-jozsa` → test if a function is constant or balanced
   * *…and more!* Check `/docs` for the full list.
