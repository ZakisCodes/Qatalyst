# Qatalyst: Quantum Algorithm API Hub 🚀

Welcome to **Qatalyst**! This project bundles a suite of cool quantum computing algorithms into easy-to-use FastAPI endpoints. Whether you’re a quantum-curious beginner or a seasoned pro, my goal is to help you explore and understand these algorithms—and see how they can solve real problems.

## ✨ Why Qatalyst?

* **Learn by Doing**: Dive into practical implementations of classic quantum algorithms.
* **Modular & Extensible**: Pick and choose which algorithms you want to play with via simple API calls.
* **Hands-On Applications**: See the power of quantum computing in action, from search problems to optimization.

## 🔌 Tech Stack

* **FastAPI**: Lightning-fast Python web framework for building APIs.
* **Qiskit**: IBM’s open-source SDK for working with quantum circuits and simulators.
* **Future Frontend (TBD)**: HTML, CSS, JavaScript—coming soon if you’d like a more interactive UI!

```

## 🚀 Getting Started

1. **Clone the repo**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/qatalyst.git
   cd qatalyst
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Run the server**

   ```bash
   uvicorn src.qatalyst.main:app --reload
   ```

4. **Explore the endpoints**

   * `POST /grover` → run Grover’s search
   * `POST /deutsch-jozsa` → test if a function is constant or balanced
   * *…and more!* Check `/docs` for the full list.
